## Package with SQL-tool 

### **1. Installation**
Navigate to the directory /Mini_Project7_LinHui with files: "setup.py", "main.py", and "Deaths&Insurance.db".

Install the package using the following command:
```bash
pip install .
```

### **2. Usage**
In the directory /Mini_Project7_LinHui, run the tool using:

```bash
SQL-tool
```

It will print the first 5 rows of the result.

The provided SQL query aims to join the two tables on the State column and aggregate data to find the total observed deaths, potentially excess deaths, and the average percentage of potentially excess deaths for each state in 2015. Additionally, it fetches relevant health insurance data from 2015. The results are sorted based on the total number of potentially excess deaths.
